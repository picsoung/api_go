# Go API with 3scale management

This is an example project of an API written in Go, using [Gin framework](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/) framework, and  [3scale](http://3scale.net) API management solution.

To make it work you need a [3scale](http://3scale.net) account and replace `YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY` by your own  [3scale](http://3scale.net) provider key.

This is a work in progress, feel free to contribute, I am not a go expert.
